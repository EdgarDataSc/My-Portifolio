## Projects

Below are some of the projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in various areas of Data Science:

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Automation with Python**
- **Description**: This project involved automating the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis. I used Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to preprocess the data and identify anomalies.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Regular Expressions
